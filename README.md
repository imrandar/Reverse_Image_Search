# Reverse Image Search using deep learning models.


Have you ever wondered how google image search works or How amazon can retrieve products similar to the image that we upload in the app/site? To achieve this task we will be using one simple method.

We are going to pick a pre-trained deep learning model, remove the top layers, and extract the convolutional features for the images in our dataset. Then we will use these feature vectors to find similar images by using sklearn's nearest neighbor algorithm.
